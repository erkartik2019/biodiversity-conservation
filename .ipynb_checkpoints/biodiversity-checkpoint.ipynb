    "\n",
    "The primary goal of this project is to analyze biodiversity conservation efforts within the U.S. National Parks by leveraging data on endangered species and their recorded sightings. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* Analyze Conservation Statuses: Examine patterns in the types of species that are more likely to have endangered, threatened, or other conservation statuses.\n",
    "* Identify Trends and Themes: Investigate whether specific categories of species (e.g., mammals, birds, plants) are more prone to endangerment.\n",
    "* Evaluate Park-Level Observations: Use the observations dataset to determine which national parks are encountering these species most frequently and assess whether there are geographical patterns.\n",
    "* Generate Insights for Conservation Efforts: Provide actionable insights into biodiversity trends that can inform conservation efforts and policy-making."
